# Ski Turn Detection & Classification

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Master's thesis:  
**"Development of an AI-Based System for Detecting and Segmenting Turns in Alpine Skiing"**  
(_Entwicklung eines KI-gestÃ¼tzten Systems zur Erkennung und Segmentierung von SchwÃ¼ngen im alpinen Skilauf_)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The project develops a deep learning pipeline that:
- Detects ski turns in video footage.
- Classifies different turn types and directions.
- Uses only video input â€” no additional sensors needed.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Automate ski turn detection without invasive equipment.
- Achieve robust performance across various turn types and directions.
- Provide a scalable framework for sports analytics.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source:** 1,059 skiing videos, reduced to 706 after quality checks.
- **Split:** 70% training, 15% validation, 15% test.
- **Classes:** CL, EKK, PD, PDK, PDL, PGK, PGL, PS.

## ðŸ›  Feature Extraction
From 3D joint coordinates, the following features were computed:
- Distance from Center of Mass (CoM) to ground.
- Knee angles (left & right).
- Segment-to-axis angles.
- Axes orientations for shoulders, hips, feet.
- Orientation vector from ankle midpoint to CoM.

## ðŸ¤– Model Architectures

### 1. **Turn Type Classifier**
- **Model:** Bidirectional LSTM (2 layers, 128 hidden units each way).
- **Attention mechanism** after LSTM layers.
- **Loss:** Focal Loss for class imbalance.
- **Optimizer:** Adam (lr=0.001).
- **Training:** Up to 300 epochs with early stopping (patience=30).

### 2. **Turn Direction Classifier**
- **Model:** Bidirectional LSTM (same setup).
- **Loss:** Cross-entropy.
- **Optimizer:** Adam (lr=0.001).
